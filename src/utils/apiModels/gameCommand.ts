// Recorded-RNG fields — the `recorded…` convention described in
// docs/turn-recap-and-planning.md — exist so replaying a command reproduces the
// randomness it consumed the first time it ran. Every Execute that consumes
// randomness therefore *prefers* a recorded value over rolling afresh
// (`this.recordedRoll ?? DiceRoll(6)`), which makes them the one part of a
// command a client must never be allowed to supply: /api/game/command
// deserialises the request body straight into a command instance, so without
// this a player could post {"recordedRoll": 6} and pick their own dice.
//
// Replay is the only legitimate source of these values. buildTimeline() feeds
// commands either from persisted commandHistory (already trusted) or from a
// player's own hypothetical planned moves (never saved, and only ever shown
// back to that player), so it deliberately does not call this.
